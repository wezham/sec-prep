# Hypervisors

Give us an abstraction on top of hardware. Historically machines used to be tied
to the hardware. Now with the power of a hypervisor it makes virtualisation possible.

Benefits of consolidation. Purchase one giant machine and install many instances
of OS on one machine. 

## Type 1 Hypervisor 

Native/Bare Metal. No underlying OS, only a hypervisor. 

## Type 2 Hypervisor ( Hosted )

Install an OS, then install a hypervisor. AWS, goDaddy
